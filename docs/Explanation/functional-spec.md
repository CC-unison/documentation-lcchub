# Motivation

I never actually learned to write a "system requirements specification (SRS)" following the
all mighty ISO/IEEE 27110 (kudos to SWE 1 & 2 class). However, in the spirit of writing
documentation as a way to transfer knowledge, let's try to write a functional specification in
the vein of this blog [Painless Functional Specifications â€“ Part 1: Why Bother?](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/10/02/painless-functional-specifications-part-1-why-bother/).

## Disclaimer

This spec is a living document, it's not complete to the best of my knowledge,
if something is missing please tell us.

## Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: Jaz**

Jaz is a busy student and entrepreneur.
She is part of the LCC community, but she often misses events happening on campus.
She has a lot of responsibilities, including her studies, running her business,
and planning her wedding, which leaves her with little time to check the
bulletin boards or ask her classmates about upcoming events.
She would like a way to stay notified of upcoming events related to LCC that she can attend.

#### features

- a list of upcoming events
- a list of previous events
- a separation between official events and student-related events
- a way to stay informed using her computer or mobile phone

#### wishlist

- notifications by email
- social media integration

### **Scenario 2: Edelmira**

Edelmira is a professor at the computer science department at Universidad de Sonora.
She has been teaching for many years and has witnessed numerous student generations come and go.
Recently, she has noticed that some current students seem uncertain about their future careers.
To address this issue, Edelmira came up with the idea of inviting graduated students to
share their experiences with the rest of the student body. However,
she faces a challenge in finding a suitable platform to share these testimonials
to the entire LCC community.

#### features

- a list to link the yt videos (soylcc)

#### wishlist

- videos saved and served in a local server
